Each word have compilation semantics and execution semantics. 
Compilation semantics:
accept on top of stack pointer to word
perform compilation (or other actions) when the word is compiled
Cxecution semantics defines word behaviour when it is invoked

:macro will compile the compilation semantics of each of the word during compilation and execution semantics 
during intepretation.
